====================
Surface meshs are based on a cortex segmentation of a whole-brain MP2RAGE acquisition and are transformed to the native epi space of the functional time series.

*lh.layer0_def2_smooth: left hemisphere GM/CSF boundary surface.
*lh.layer10_def2_smooth: left hemisphere GM/WM boundary surface.
*mean_epi.nii: time series mean epi.
*mean_epi_enhanced.nii: time series mean epi with enhanced GM/WM contrast.
*vein.nii: binary image which masks out regions with noticeable signal dropout.
*ignore.nii: binary image which masks out regions where GBB is applied.
*control_points.dat: point set of anchor points.
