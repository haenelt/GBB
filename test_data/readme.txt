====================
Surface meshs are based on a cortex segmentation of a whole-brain MP2RAGE acquisition and are transformed to the native epi space of the functional time series.

*./fmap: fieldmap data
*./surf/rigid/lh.layer10_def2_smooth: left hemisphere GM/WM boundary surface.
*./surf/rigid/lh.layer0_def2_smooth: left hemisphere GM/CSF boundary surface.
*./surf/nonrigid/lh.layer10_def2_smooth: left hemisphere GM/WM boundary surface.
*./surf/nonrigid/lh.layer0_def2_smooth: left hemisphere GM/CSF boundary surface.

*./surf/rigid_fmap/lh.layer0_def2_smooth_def_smooth: left hemisphere GM/CSF boundary surface.
*./data/mean_epi: time series mean epi.
*./data/mean_epi_enhanced: time series mean epi with enhanced GM/WM contrast.
*./data/vein: binary image which masks out regions with noticeable signal dropout.
