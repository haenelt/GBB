====================
Surface meshs are based on a cortex segmentation of a whole-brain MP2RAGE acquisition and are rigidly transformed to the native epi space of the functional time series.

*lh.layer0_def: left hemisphere GM/CSF boundary surface.
*rh.layer0_def: right hemisphere GM/CSF boundary surface.
*lh.layer10_def: left hemisphere GM/WM boundary surface.
*rh.layer10_def: right hemisphere GM/WM boundary surface.
*mean_epi: time series mean epi.
*tscore_left_right: functional contrast (left eye > right eye stimulation).
*vein: binary image which masks out regions with noticeable signal dropout.
