to do:
# shift vertex
# update neighbouring vertices
# iterate

might be changed:
# valid shift not end point of gradient line?
# take always max or decide between min and max depending on location/intensity?
# set gradient threshold or dictate decrasing shift for each iterations?
# when to exit loop?
